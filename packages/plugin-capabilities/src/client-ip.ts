/**
 * client-ip.ts - best-effort trustworthy client IP for the capability audit
 * trail.
 *
 * Mirrors `@stwd/api`'s `trustedClientIp` (routes/auth.ts); the plugin cannot
 * import the core (circular dependency - the core builds and injects the
 * plugin context), so the same rules are re-implemented here and read the SAME
 * operator env vars:
 *
 * - cf-connecting-ip is honored only when STEWARD_TRUST_CLOUDFLARE=true AND
 *   origin ingress is locked to Cloudflare; otherwise the header is
 *   client-forgeable and ignored.
 * - x-envoy-external-address / x-forwarded-for are consulted only once the
 *   operator opts into a trusted edge via STEWARD_TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS: the N
 *   trusted proxies APPEND the peer they observed, so the client entry is the
 *   N-th from the RIGHT. The left-most x-forwarded-for entry is
 *   client-supplied and never read.
 * - x-real-ip is deliberately not consulted: no proxy in this topology sets it
 *   authoritatively, so a client-set value would pass through verbatim.
 *
 * Every candidate is validated with isIP (after unambiguous :port stripping).
 * With no trust configured the raw headers are spoofable by any caller, so
 * undefined is returned and the audit row records NULL rather than an
 * attacker-chosen IP (fail closed).
