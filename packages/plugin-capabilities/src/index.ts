/**
 * @stwd/plugin-capabilities - the opt-in capability plugin for Steward.
 *
 * a CAPABILITY is a NAMED, narrowly-scoped use of a stored secret
 * (e.g. "github.pr.comment" -> secretId + host + path + method + header
 * injection). a GRANT says "agent X may use capability Y" (optionally until an
 * expiry). the plugin's job is to keep, per grant, exactly one legal narrow
 * secret_route - the row the already-defended proxy consumes to inject the
 * credential outbound. the plugin NEVER decrypts a secret and NEVER injects a
 * credential itself; it maintains the route rows the proxy matches.
 *
 * this package uses the shipped plugin SDK contribution points:
 *   - migrations (2c): plugin-owned, namespaced-journal `capabilities` +
 *     `capability_grants` tables (isolated from the core migration ledger).
 *   - routes (2a register): operator/tenant-auth capability + grant CRUD, plus
 *     the agent-scoped "what may this agent use" read.
 *   - webhookEvents (2a): the events THIS package emits at CRUD time.
 *
 * SCOPE (W-1a): schema + CRUD + grants + paired-route lifecycle ONLY. there is
 * NO policy evaluation and NO invoke/forward path here (those are W-1b / W-1c).
 * the package builds + tests STANDALONE and is NOT registered in the api
 * composition root yet (that wiring is W-1c's job).
 *
 * the core never imports this package, and this package never imports `@stwd/api`:
 * the shared service singletons + auth middleware the routes need are INJECTED via
 * the `StewardAppContext` the core hands `register(app, ctx)` (no dependency cycle).
