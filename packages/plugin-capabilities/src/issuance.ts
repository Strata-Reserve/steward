/**
 * Capability issuance, renewal, and revocation core.
 *
 * This is the token/broker issuance layer that sits ON TOP of the already-shipped
 * capability plumbing (capabilities + grants + the proxy-broker invoke path). It
 * does NOT re-implement credential injection, policy evaluation, or the grant
 * lifecycle — it maps a per-agent MANIFEST entry to an issuance decision:
 *
 *   • token mode  → is handled by upstream-leases.ts. This module must never
 *                   substitute a Steward JWT for a provider credential.
 *   • broker mode → return a DELEGATION descriptor telling the agent to invoke
 *                   through Steward's existing broker endpoint
 *                   (POST /capabilities/:name/invoke); the credential never
 *                   leaves the enclave.
 *
 * RENEWAL: tokens are deliberately short-lived (minutes). The agent re-requests
 * (renew == issue again); each renewal re-checks the live manifest, so a
 * revocation (policy/grant edit) takes effect at the NEXT renewal — bounded by
 * the configured short TTL.
 *
 * REVOCATION: there is no token-revocation call here by design — short TTL +
 * re-check-on-renew IS the revocation mechanism (an operator disables the
 * capability or revokes the grant via the existing CRUD routes; the next renewal
 * sees no usable grant and denies). For the rare "kill it NOW" case, the existing
 * JWT revocation store (@stwd/auth revocationStore, jti-based) remains available;
 * we surface the minted jti so a caller can revoke it if needed.
 *
 * AUDIT: every enroll/issue/renew/revoke/exercise emits a structured event
 * through the injected `emitAudit` sink. This file defines the event shape and emits it; it does not
 * own the sink.
