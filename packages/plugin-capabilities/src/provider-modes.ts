/**
 * provider-modes.ts — the PROVIDER-MODES registry + manifest-identifier grammar.
 *
 * A per-agent capability MANIFEST is a declarative list of abstract capability
 * identifiers of the form:
 *
 *     provider:kind[:agent]
 *
 * e.g. `discord:bot-token:soliza`, `github:app:0xSolace`, `llm:pool-seat`,
 *      `wallet:sign`.
 *
 * When an agent requests a manifest capability, Steward answers in one of two
 * MODES:
 *
 *   • token mode  — Steward returns a SHORT-LIVED, SCOPED token the agent uses
 *                   directly against the provider (or against Steward's own
 *                   scoped surface). Only honest when the provider's tokens can
 *                   actually be down-scoped/short-lived.
 *
 *   • broker mode — Steward performs the upstream call ON BEHALF of the agent
 *                   (the credential never leaves the enclave). This is the honest
 *                   default whenever a provider's long-lived secret CANNOT be
 *                   down-scoped. Discord bot tokens are the canonical example:
 *                   Discord has no mechanism to mint a narrower, short-lived bot
 *                   token, so handing the raw token to an agent would defeat the
 *                   whole point — broker mode keeps it in the enclave and the
 *                   agent only ever gets a brokered result.
 *
 * This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for which mode a provider uses. It is
 * pure (no db, no io) so it is trivially unit-testable and can be shared by the
 * client SDK (A3) and docs generation.
 *
 * Broker mode reuses the ALREADY-SHIPPED capability invoke path (invoke.ts /
 * @stwd/proxy-client): the credential is injected by the defended proxy and the
 * agent receives only the scrubbed upstream response. We do NOT build a parallel
 * broker; the manifest layer maps a manifest entry to a broker-mode capability
 * invocation.
