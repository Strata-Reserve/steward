/**
 * CI guard for the governed-execution gateway.
 *
 * The migrated primary EVM `/vault/:agentId/sign` route and its compatible
 * approval replay must never reach the raw `Vault.signTransaction` signer
 * without going through GovernedVault authorization. Because the vault route
 * file legitimately contains a Solana raw fallback (primary sign) and a
 * transfer raw fallback (approval replay), a naive "ban raw sign" static rule is
 * brittle. Instead we assert the invariant guards that make those fallbacks
 * unreachable for primary-EVM/approval flows are present, and that the security
 * surface honestly scopes the gateway claim.
