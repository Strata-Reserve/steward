/**
 * SEC-166: pin the Workers (neon-http) audit-append posture.
 *
 * The Workers contract must account for advisory locks used by the
 * audit chain acquires `pg_advisory_xact_lock` on every non-PGLite append
 * (`appendAuditEvent`, `withTenantAuditedTransaction`). On Workers the point
 * is moot today: drizzle's neon-http driver throws
 * "No transactions support in neon-http driver" from `db.transaction()`, so
 * an audited write rejects BEFORE any statement — lock or INSERT — runs.
 * Audited actions on Workers therefore FAIL CLOSED (the action is denied);
 * the chain is never silently skipped.
 *
 * These tests pin that contract. A future drizzle upgrade that adds neon-http
 * transaction support will break them — that is intentional: it forces an
 * explicit re-review of whether `pg_advisory_xact_lock` over the HTTP
 * transport provides the per-tenant serialization the chain requires.
