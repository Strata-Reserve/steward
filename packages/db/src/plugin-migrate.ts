/**
 * plugin-migrate.ts — plugin-owned database migrations with NAMESPACED journals.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (Phase 2c)
 * --------------------------
 * a steward plugin (e.g. trading) may own tables the lean core does not know
 * about. it declares its schema via a {@link PluginMigrationSource}: its OWN
 * drizzle migrations folder (with its OWN `meta/_journal.json`). the host applies
 * those migrations through this runner.
 *
 * THE ISOLATION GUARANTEE (the whole point)
 * -----------------------------------------
 * a plugin's applied-migrations bookkeeping is recorded in a SEPARATE, per-plugin
 * table derived from the plugin's `id`:
 *
 *     drizzle.__drizzle_migrations_plugin_<sanitized id>
 *
 * NEVER in the core's `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`. drizzle's migrator is told
 * (via the `migrationsTable` option) to read/write ONLY that namespaced table, so
 * it is structurally IMPOSSIBLE for a plugin migration to be recorded in, read
 * from, or otherwise clobber the core's migration journal. the core's
 * `runMigrations()` (packages/db/src/migrate.ts) is left BYTE-IDENTICAL; this is
 * a wholly separate function with a separate ledger.
 *
 * Two plugins also cannot collide with each other: their ids derive distinct
 * table names (and distinct advisory-lock keys), so each plugin owns exactly one
 * isolated ledger.
 *
 * CONCURRENCY
 * -----------
 * like the core migrator, each plugin run takes a Postgres session advisory lock
 * (a PER-PLUGIN key derived from the id, distinct from the core's
 * "steward_migrations" key) so concurrent API replicas don't race applying the
 * same plugin's migrations on boot. the lock is released in a `finally`.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED
 * -----------
 * an id that sanitizes to empty is rejected (a plugin MUST have a usable
 * namespace). any migration error propagates to the caller (the host surfaces it
 * loudly and refuses to half-boot). idempotency is inherited from drizzle's
 * migrator: re-running with the same (already-recorded) migrations applies
 * nothing.
