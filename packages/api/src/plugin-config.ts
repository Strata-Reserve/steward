/**
 * plugin-config.ts — deploy-time plugin enablement resolver.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * the composition root (`compose.ts`) assembles the deployable server: the lean
 * core (`createApp()`) plus this deploy's opt-in plugins. historically that set
 * was HARDCODED — `composeApp()` always registered the trading plugin and
 * `runComposedPluginMigrations()` always collected its migrations. that coupled
 * the SHIPPED IMAGE to a single feature profile: every deploy ran trading,
 * whether or not it was wanted.
 *
 * this resolver makes the same image run LEAN (core only) or FULL (core + opt-in
 * plugins) purely by ENVIRONMENT, with NO change to what any plugin does. it only
 * answers ONE question: "which opt-in plugins should the composition root
 * register?" the actual registration, ordering, and migration logic is untouched
 * (see compose.ts) — this only gates WHETHER trading is composed in, never HOW.
 *
 * THE CONTRACT
 * ------------
 *   - `STEWARD_PLUGINS` — comma-separated plugin names, e.g. "trading". each name
 *     is trimmed + lowercased. empty/unset → LEAN (no opt-in plugins).
 *   - `STEWARD_ENABLE_TRADING=true` — legacy boolean that ALSO enables trading
 *     (union with STEWARD_PLUGINS), so an older deploy config keeps working.
 *   - an UNKNOWN plugin name in `STEWARD_PLUGINS` → THROW at boot. fail-closed +
 *     loud: a typo'd / unsupported plugin name never silently disables a feature
 *     a deploy expected, it refuses to boot with a clear error.
 *
 * PARITY (load-bearing)
 * ---------------------
 * BOTH the app-composition path (`composeApp`) and the migration-composition path
 * (`runComposedPluginMigrations`) call THIS resolver, so a plugin's routes and
 * its migrations are always BOTH-on or BOTH-off. they can never drift into an
 * orphaned state (routes mounted with no schema, or schema migrated with no
 * routes). the single source of truth is here.

/**
 * Resolve which opt-in plugins this deploy should register, from the environment.

 * Reads:
 *   - `STEWARD_PLUGINS` — comma-separated names (trimmed, lowercased, empties
 *     dropped). unset/empty → no plugins (LEAN).
 *   - `STEWARD_ENABLE_TRADING` — legacy boolean; `"true"` (case-insensitive,
 *     trimmed) ALSO adds "trading" to the set.
 *
 * FAILS CLOSED: any name in `STEWARD_PLUGINS` not in {@link KNOWN_PLUGIN_NAMES}
 * throws {@link UnknownPluginError}. The legacy boolean only ever adds a KNOWN
 * name, so it cannot trip the unknown-name guard.
 *
 * @param env the environment to read. defaults to `process.env`; injectable so
 *   tests can drive it hermetically without mutating the real process env.
