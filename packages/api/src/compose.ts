/**
 * compose.ts — the COMPOSITION ROOT that assembles the deployable Steward
 * server: the lean core (`createApp()`) plus the opt-in plugins this repo's own
 * deployment can enable (trading, capabilities, and wxmr).
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE COMPOSITION ROOT
 * -------------------------------
 * `app.ts`'s `createApp()` is the LEAN CORE: trading-free, with no dependency on
 * the trading stack. a third party importing `@stwd/api` and calling `createApp()`
 * gets exactly that. THIS repo's deployed server (index.ts / worker.ts /
 * embedded.ts) can run the SAME image LEAN (core only) or FULL (core + trading)
 * by environment: `composeApp()` consults `resolveEnabledPlugins()`
 * (`plugin-config.ts`, reading `STEWARD_PLUGINS` / legacy `STEWARD_ENABLE_TRADING`)
 * and only registers the trading plugin when it is enabled. that keeps the library
 * core lean, the deploy configurable, and — in FULL mode — behavior-identical to
 * the historical hardcoded composition.
 *
 * ORDERING (load-bearing — money rail)
 * ------------------------------------
 * the global idempotency middleware must run AFTER all per-route auth middleware
 * (it reads the auth-populated request context to decide replay-safety) and BEFORE
 * any route it should wrap (a route handler that returns a response ends the chain,
 * so a route registered before the idempotency `app.use("*")` would never be
 * idempotency-wrapped). so the required registration order is:
 *
 *   [global mw] -> [all auth mw: core + plugin] -> [idempotency] -> [all routes: core + plugin]
 *
 * a plugin contributes BOTH auth middleware (before idempotency) and routes (after
 * idempotency). a single `register(app, ctx)` can't straddle the idempotency
 * boundary, so we hand the plugin a DEFERRED-ROUTE app: `app.use(...)` registers
 * middleware immediately (lands before idempotency), while `app.route(...)` /
 * `app.get(...)` etc. are BUFFERED and flushed AFTER idempotency. this reproduces
 * the exact pre-refactor ordering (trade auth -> idempotency -> trade routes).
