/**
 * Repository-wide CI guard for the PR4 execution gateway raw-signer inventory.
 *
 * This scans EVERY production TypeScript file under packages/api/src (excluding
 * __tests__) and counts raw member-call `.signTransaction(` sites in ANY form
 * (vault.signTransaction(, getVault().signTransaction(, signer.signTransaction(,
 * this.vault.signTransaction(, someVault.signTransaction(, whitespace variants).
 * It then asserts a one-for-one match against the shared inventory:
 *
 *  - every file that has a raw call is enumerated in RAW_EVM_SIGN_EXPECTED_COUNTS
 *    with the EXACT count (adding a raw call to intents.ts / user.ts / a NEW file
 *    fails until the inventory is updated and classifies the new hit),
 *  - no inventory file may have fewer raw calls than enumerated (deleting an
 *    inventory entry without removing the call, or vice versa, fails),
 *  - each inventory row's stable marker is present in its file (so the
 *    classification anchors to a real, findable call site rather than a brittle
 *    line number).
 *
 * It also guards against BARE-IDENTIFIER references (destructured / aliased
 * forms such as `const { signTransaction } = vault`) that would smuggle a raw
 * signer past the member-call scan. Every `signTransaction` occurrence that is
 * NOT a governed `.signTransactionAuthorized(` call and NOT a counted raw
 * member-call must be one of a tiny allow-list of benign non-call forms
 * (an object-property capability key, a documentation comment). Anything else
 * fails with an instruction to classify or remove it.
 *
 * The bar: adding a raw sign call in ANY form/file fails CI with a
 * classification instruction. The scan lives in packages/api (not
 * packages/shared) so it never statically imports across package rootDirs; it
 * only reads source files off disk, which is exactly what a scanner should do
 * (avoids the TS6059 cross-rootDir hazard).
