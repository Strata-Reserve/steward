/**
 * plugin.ts — the lean-core + opt-in-plugin seam for the Steward app.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * steward serves two audiences from one codebase: teams that want only the auth +
 * embedded-wallet + policy core, and teams that ALSO want agent trading (venue
 * execution + trade sessions). historically these were coupled: `@stwd/api`
 * hard-depended on the trading stack (`@stwd/trade-sessions`, `@stwd/venue-*`) and
 * the trade routes imported the venue adapters directly, so an auth-only install
 * still compiled + shipped the entire trading stack (the venue SDKs, ethers, clob
 * clients) — an unnecessary install-size, supply-chain, and audit-surface cost for
 * the majority of installs that never trade.
 *
 * the architecture here is a LEAN OPEN CORE (auth + vault + policy + proxy +
 * webhooks) plus OPT-IN PLUGINS that a host registers. trading is the first such
 * plugin (`@stwd/plugin-trading`). this mirrors the plugin model of mature
 * frameworks (fastify/vite/hono-style `app.register(plugin)`): take only what you
 * need, and anyone can write + register their own plugin.
 *
 * THE SEAM
 * --------
 * a plugin contributes hono routes + middleware via `register(app, ctx)`:
 *   - `app` is the steward hono app.
 *   - `ctx` is the {@link StewardAppContext} the core BUILDS and hands the plugin:
 *     the shared service singletons (db, vault, policy engine, price oracle, audit
 *     writer, token-status reader, redis client) and the auth middleware a plugin
 *     installs on its own routes (requireAgentJwt, operatorAuth, tenantAuth).
 *
 * injecting `ctx` is what lets a plugin live in its OWN package without importing
 * `@stwd/api`: the core does not import any plugin, and a plugin does not import the
 * core, so the dependency stays one-directional (no cycle). the core never depends
 * on a plugin's transitive deps.
 *
 * a third party registers a plugin at the composition root (the deployable server
 * entrypoint), NOT inside the core app:
 *
 *   import { createApp, buildPluginContext, registerPlugin } from "@stwd/api";
 *   import { tradingPlugin } from "@stwd/plugin-trading";
 *
 *   const app = createApp();                 // lean core, no trading
 *   await registerPlugin(app, tradingPlugin, buildPluginContext());
 *
 * that way `@stwd/api` itself stays trading-free for anyone importing it, while a
 * deploy that wants trading opts in by registering the plugin.
