# #206 cumulativeSpend + configurable-window mutation-strength proofs. Each
# mutation weakens ONE load-bearing guard; a proof is valid iff the named test
# PASSES clean AND FAILS after the mutation. The target file is restored after
# each proof.
#
# Three guards live in the policy-engine composer (capability-intent.ts) and are
# proven by the DB-less policy-engine unit suite. Two live in the Redis atomic
# reservation tracker (cumulative-spend-tracker.ts) and are proven by the
# redis tracker suite against a real Redis (STEWARD_REDIS_TESTS=1). Run from
# packages/api:
#
#   STEWARD_REDIS_TESTS=1 REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 \
#     bash scripts/cumulative-spend-mutation-proofs.sh
#
# A non-zero exit means at least one guard was NOT killed by its mutation.
