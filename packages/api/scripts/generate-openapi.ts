 * Emit the OpenAPI 3.1 document from the live route definitions.

 * truth; this script renders them to `openapi.json` (consumed by the SDK type
 * generator) and copies it to `docs/api-reference/openapi.json` (consumed by
 * Mintlify). Run it whenever a route's schema changes:
 *
 *   bun scripts/generate-openapi.ts        # or: bun run openapi:generate
 *
 * It imports the generated contract directly — no server is started and no DB is
 * touched.
