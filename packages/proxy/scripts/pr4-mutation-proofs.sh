# PR4 mutation-strength proofs (spec §11.5). Each mutation weakens ONE security
# predicate; a proof is valid iff the named test PASSES clean AND FAILS after the
# mutation. Every mutated file is restored after each proof.
#
# The proofs span three packages (the governed decrypt path is distributed
# across the proxy + api + plugin per contradiction C2): each proof runs the
# affected test in its home package.
#
#   Run from the repo root:  bash packages/proxy/scripts/pr4-mutation-proofs.sh
#
# Requires: @stwd/shared + @stwd/redis + @stwd/db dist built (tsc) first, so the
# proxy/api/plugin suites import the compiled crypto.
