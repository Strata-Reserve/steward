/**
 * @stwd/plugin-trading — the opt-in trading plugin for Steward.
 *
 * the steward core (`@stwd/api`) is lean: auth, wallet/vault, policy, proxy,
 * webhooks. trading (venue execution + trade sessions + operator fund-recovery)
 * is NOT in the core. it lives here, behind the `StewardPlugin` register seam,
 * so installs that only want the core never pull the venue SDKs (ethers, clob
 * clients, ...) — smaller install, smaller supply-chain + audit surface for the
 * majority of installs that never trade.
 *
 * a host enables trading by registering this plugin at its composition root:
 *
 *   import { registerPlugin } from "@stwd/api";
 *   import { tradingPlugin } from "@stwd/plugin-trading";
 *   await registerPlugin(app, tradingPlugin, ctx);
 *
 * the core does NOT import this package, and this package does NOT import the
 * core: the shared service singletons + auth middleware the trade routes need are
 * INJECTED via the `StewardAppContext` the core hands `register(app, ctx)`. that
 * keeps the dependency one-directional (no cycle).
