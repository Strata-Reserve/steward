# Steward

**Steward is an open-source, self-hostable governed credential proxy and policy and approval layer for agent provider actions and wallets.** Supported integrations use scoped grants and configured routes instead of receiving provider credentials directly. The primary EVM transaction sign path adds a signed, single-use execution authorization before raw signing.

## What It Does

Agents running inside containers typically get credentials injected as plain environment variables:

```bash
# Dangerous: raw credentials in the environment
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=0xdeadbeef...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abc123...
```

Any code running in that container — including code triggered by prompt injection — can exfiltrate them. There's no spending control, no audit trail, no way to rotate without redeployment.

With Steward, agents only get two variables:

```bash
# Safe: Steward proxy + agent token
STEWARD_PROXY_URL=http://steward-proxy:8080
STEWARD_AGENT_TOKEN=stwd_jwt_...
```

Proxy-bound agent tokens must be minted with the explicit `api:proxy` scope
(`scopes: ["agent", "api:proxy"]`). Legacy tokens that only carry
`scope: "agent"` are still accepted by the proxy with a deprecation warning for
the next 1-2 release cycles, but new deployments should opt in when creating the
token.

Supported transactions and API calls flow through Steward routes, where they are authenticated, policy-checked, logged, and metered before Vault signing or proxy credential injection happens.

## Core Primitives

| Primitive | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Wallet Vault** | AES-256-GCM encrypted key storage for EVM and Solana keypairs. Governed API routes request signatures without returning private keys to the caller. |
| **Policy Engine** | Declarative rules evaluated by supported signing routes before Vault calls: spending limits, address whitelists, rate limits, time windows, chain filters, auto-approve thresholds. |
| **Secret Vault** | Encrypted credential storage. Configured proxy routes inject secrets server-side instead of returning them to the supported agent caller. |
| **API Proxy** | Routes agent HTTP calls through Steward for credential injection, cost tracking, and audit logging. |
| **Approval Queue** | Large or unusual transactions queue for human review before execution. |
| **Webhooks** | Push notifications on `tx.pending`, `tx.signed`, `tx.approved`, `tx.denied`, `policy.violation`, `spend.threshold`. |

## Two Deployment Modes

**Embedded (local)** — Uses PGLite (Postgres-in-WASM). No external database. Ideal for desktop tools, local dev, and single-user deployments.

```bash
bun run start:local
```

**PostgreSQL** — Backed by PostgreSQL, optional Redis for rate limiting and spend tracking. For self-hosted production deployments that need a durable third-party database.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## Who Uses Steward

- **Production multi-agent deployments** — A production deployment managing dozens of AI agents across a node fleet on Base mainnet
- **Agent developers** — Anyone building autonomous agents that need wallet access or API credential management
- **Platform operators** — Teams running multi-tenant agent hosting who need security, cost control, and compliance
- **Desktop apps** — Local mode with PGLite runs as an embedded sidecar with zero external dependencies
