# Railway Deploy Script
# Updates Railway service to use a new Docker image via GraphQL API,
# polls for deployment success, and verifies the /health endpoint.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/railway-deploy.sh <image-tag> [--dry-run]
#   e.g. ./scripts/railway-deploy.sh v0.5.0
#        ./scripts/railway-deploy.sh develop --dry-run
#
# Environment variables:
#   RAILWAY_TOKEN       (required) Railway API bearer token
#   RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID  (REQUIRED) the deployer's own Railway service id
#   RAILWAY_ENV_ID      (REQUIRED) the deployer's own Railway environment id
#   RAILWAY_IMAGE_REPO  (optional) default: ghcr.io/steward-fi/steward (the
#                                  canonical published OSS image)
#   RAILWAY_HEALTH_URL  (optional) the deployer's own /health URL to verify
#   DEPLOY_TIMEOUT      (optional) max seconds to wait for deploy, default: 300
#   RAILWAY_ALLOW_REJECTED_DEPLOY (optional, default: fail closed) when "true",
#                       a deployment Railway rejected before any container ran
#                       (no build/deploy logs) degrades to a non-fatal warning
#                       instead of failing the pipeline. SEC-129: the default
#                       is a HARD failure — a green pipeline that silently
#                       shipped nothing is how a security fix looks deployed
#                       when it is not.
